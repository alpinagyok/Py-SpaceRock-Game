# Py-SpaceRock-Game

This project was created in my first semester of university. This is **NOT meant to show how well I know python**. However, it is here as a "snippet" because I don't have python projects that I can make public.

## To play

- Install Python 3.6 or higher
- 'pip install pygame'
- Run game.py
